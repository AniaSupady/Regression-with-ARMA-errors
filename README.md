#Overview
The repository provides a Python implementation of regression with ARMA errors for time series forecasting.
It includes a Jupyter Notebook that walks through the steps of the analysis.
#Key Steps
Import Libraries: The project uses popular Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, statsmodels, and matplotlib for data manipulation, statistical modeling, and visualization.
Load Data: The dataset used is the "AirPassengers" dataset, which is a classic time series dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis: The notebook performs basic exploratory data analysis, including plotting the time series and checking for stationarity.
Regression with ARMA Errors: The project demonstrates how to fit a regression model with ARMA errors using the statsmodels library.
Model Evaluation: The notebook evaluates the performance of the model using metrics such as mean squared error and mean absolute error.
Forecasting: The project shows how to use the fitted model to generate forecasts for future time periods.
#Key Takeaways
Regression with ARMA errors is a powerful technique for modeling time series data that incorporates both predictor variables and autocorrelation.
The statsmodels library in Python provides an easy-to-use implementation of this technique.
The project demonstrates a clear workflow for time series forecasting, from data loading to model evaluation and forecasting.
Overall, the repository provides a useful example of how to implement regression with ARMA errors in Python for time series forecasting.
